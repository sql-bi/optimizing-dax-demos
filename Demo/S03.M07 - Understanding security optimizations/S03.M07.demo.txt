You can start from Contoso 100M and proceed with the step-by-step demo.

If you want to quickly create a model with all the security roles,
you can use the following template files and regenerate the Contoso 100M
by reading the data from Contoso 100M database on a SQL Server available
on the "demo" alias:
- Contoso 100M - security.pbit
    Includes all the security roles but ComplexRuleDynamicSecurity 
    (which cannot work because of conflicts with other security roles)
- Contoso 100M - security - variation A.pbit
    Includes only the ComplexRuleDynamicSecurity security role
