    f) In the "Data source settings" dialog box, click "Close"
    g) Save the file
3) Repeat all the steps in 2) for the "S05.M02.L04 Dynamic ABC.pbix"
4) Open "S05.M02.L03 Budget and Time intelligence.pbix":
    a) Open Home / Transform data / Data source settings dialog box
    b) Select the "DirectQuery to AS - Power BI Dataset;Contoso 10M (Remote)" item
